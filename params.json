This is because the manner in which our tissue adheres to dental implants is different than as on natural teeth.\r\n\r\nDental Implant is a specialized subject as there are many factors which affects the final esthetic outcome of the [dental implants](http://www.abbotsfordperiodontist.ca/#Dental-Implants). Factors such as timings of placement of implants, need for grafting of bone and soft tissue before and during the implant therapy, size of implant, position of implant, cultivation and remodeling of tissue while placing the crown can matter.\r\n\r\nA thin [receding gum](http://www.abbotsfordperiodontist.ca/#Receding-Gums) over the implant may show grayish tinge of the inner metal, the crown can appear longer and some times tissue between implants (papilla) are missing which leads to unsightly gaps.\r\n\r\nPeriodontists have undergone extensive training with regards to the treatment of dental implants and they are competent in managing the soft tissue around dental implants.  \r\n",
